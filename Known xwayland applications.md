> The easiest way is to run `xwininfo` in a terminal - then when you hover over an xwayland window the mouse pointer will turn into a + sign. If you click the window it'll display some information and end, but it won't do anything with native Wayland windows (if you have only Wayland windows open you'll have to use Ctrl+C to end it).

>  As per the reddit `xlsclients` commands also shows the xwayland apps which are currently running, though it does not list all the xwayland apps(vlc). So I guess it's ineffective.
